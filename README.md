# Wisecow Application

A containerized web application that serves random fortune cookies with ASCII art cows using the classic `cowsay` and `fortune` commands.

## Features

- Serves random fortune quotes with cowsay ASCII art
- Lightweight containerized deployment
- Kubernetes-ready with deployment and service manifests
- Health checks and resource limits configured
- Docker image published to Docker Hub

## Quick Start

### Local Development

Prerequisites for local development:
```bash
sudo apt install fortune-mod cowsay netcat -y
```

Run the application directly:
```bash
./wisecow.sh
```

The application will start on port 4499. Point your browser to `http://localhost:4499`

### Docker Deployment

Pull and run the pre-built image:
```bash
docker run -p 4499:4499 shrinidhiupadhyaya/wisecow:latest
```

Or build locally:
```bash
docker build -t wisecow .
docker run -p 4499:4499 wisecow
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

Deploy to Kubernetes cluster:
```bash
kubectl create namespace wisecow
kubectl apply -f k8s/wisecow-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/wisecow-service.yaml
```

Forward the service port to access locally:
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/wisecow-service 4499:80 -n wisecow
```

Access at `http://localhost:4499`

## Docker Image

The application uses a multi-stage Dockerfile based on Debian Slim featuring:
- Required packages: `fortune-mod`, `fortunes`, `cowsay`, `netcat-openbsd`
- Minimal security footprint with non-root user
- Optimized for container environments
- Published image: `shrinidhiupadhyaya/wisecow:latest`

## Kubernetes Configuration

### Deployment Features
- **Replicas**: 2 for high availability
- **Resources**: 100m CPU, 128Mi memory limits
- **Health Checks**: Liveness and readiness probes
- **Namespace**: wisecow
- **Image**: shrinidhiupadhyaya/wisecow:latest

### Service Configuration
- **Type**: ClusterIP
- **Port**: 80 (external) â†’ 4499 (container)
- **Selector**: app=wisecow

## What to Expect

![wisecow](https://github.com/nyrahul/wisecow/assets/9133227/8d6bfde3-4a5a-480e-8d55-3fef60300d98)

The application displays random fortune quotes with ASCII cow art, refreshing with each request.

## Health Monitoring

The application includes comprehensive health checks:
- **Liveness Probe**: HTTP GET on `/` every 30 seconds (15s initial delay)
- **Readiness Probe**: HTTP GET on `/` every 10 seconds (5s initial delay)

## Development

### Building the Image
```bash
docker build -t shrinidhiupadhyaya/wisecow:latest .
docker push shrinidhiupadhyaya/wisecow:latest
```

### Kubernetes Commands
```bash
# Check deployment status
kubectl get pods -n wisecow

# View logs
kubectl logs -n wisecow deployment/wisecow-deployment

# Check service
kubectl get svc -n wisecow
```

## Problem Statement

Deploy the wisecow application as a Kubernetes application with the following requirements:

### Requirements
1. âœ… Create Dockerfile for the image and corresponding k8s manifest to deploy in k8s env
2. âœ… The wisecow service should be exposed as k8s service
3. ðŸ”„ Github action for creating new image when changes are made to this repo
4. ðŸ”„ [Challenge goal]: Enable secure TLS communication for the wisecow app

### Expected Artifacts
1. âœ… Github repo containing the app with corresponding dockerfile, k8s manifest
2. ðŸ”„ Github repo with corresponding github action
3. âœ… Github repo access enabled for specified IDs
